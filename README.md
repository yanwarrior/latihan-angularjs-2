## Latihan Ngaular Part 2
This repo contains angularjs exercises about creating an angello-lite app that I learned in the book `Angular JS In Action`, Manning Publishing, author by `Lukas Ruebbelke` with `Brian Ford` and I am very grateful for what they teach in this book.

## Installing This App
The steps for installing this app are as follows:

* Install Node.js. You can find all of the information to do that at http://nodejs.org/.
* Install the `serve` package by running `npm install -g serve` from the command line.
* Navigate to the this app directory from the command line and run `serve`.
* Go to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see the application.
